# Timestamp Validation Analysis

## Overview
The contract uses client-provided timestamps for all time-based validation. There is no system clock integration - all time checks rely on user input.

## Core Validation Functions

### 1. `is_leaderboard_active(timestamp: u64)` (contract.rs:202-216)
**Purpose**: Validates if a leaderboard event is currently active
**Logic**:
- Only validates on non-main chains (`!is_main_chain`)
- Checks: `start_time <= timestamp <= end_time`
- **Special Bypass**: If `timestamp == 111970`, skips all validation
- **Failure**: Panics with "Leaderboard is not active"

### 2. `is_shard_active(timestamp: u64)` (contract.rs:218-232)
**Purpose**: Validates if a shard is currently active
**Logic**:
- Only validates on non-main chains (`!is_main_chain`)
- Checks: `start_time <= timestamp <= end_time`
- **Special Bypass**: If `timestamp == 111970`, skips all validation
- **Failure**: Panics with "Leaderboard is not active" (note: message says "Leaderboard" but function is for shards)

## Operation-Level Validations

### 3. LeaderboardAction (operations.rs:104-117)
**Context**: Creating or updating leaderboard events
**Validations**:
- `start_time < end_time` (strict inequality)
- `timestamp < end_time` (current time must be before event end)
- **Failure**: Panics if `timestamp >= end_time`

### 4. NewBoard (operations.rs:266-289)
**Context**: Creating new game boards
**Validations**:
- `timestamp >= start_time` (can't create board before event starts)
- `timestamp <= end_time` (can't create board after event ends)
- **Failure**: Panics with appropriate messages

### 5. GameMoveProcessor (game_logic.rs:19-32)
**Context**: Processing player moves during gameplay
**Validations**:
- `timestamp <= end_time` (if exceeded, game ends immediately)
- `timestamp > latest_timestamp` (monotonic ordering of moves)
- **Failure**: Returns Error with "Timestamp must be after latest timestamp"

## Special Cases

### Magic Number: 111970
**Usage**: Appears to be a special timestamp that bypasses all time validation
**Occurrences**:
1. `is_leaderboard_active()` - skips validation if `timestamp == 111970`
2. `is_shard_active()` - skips validation if `timestamp == 111970`
3. `handle_make_moves()` - uses `111970` when `moves.is_empty()` (line 98)

**Purpose**: Unknown, appears to be a hardcoded bypass for special operations

## Message-Level Usage

### 6. LeaderboardNewGame (messages.rs:122-142)
**Validation**: Calls `is_leaderboard_active(timestamp)` to ensure event is active

### 7. UpdateScore (messages.rs:144-208)
**Validation**: Calls `update_shard_score()` which calls `is_shard_active(timestamp)`

## Time Source Analysis

**All timestamps are client-provided**:
- No system time integration
- No server-side time validation
- Clients can manipulate timestamps freely
- Only validation is against other client-provided timestamps (start_time, end_time)

## Validation Gaps

1. **No upper bound on future timestamps**: Clients can provide arbitrarily large timestamps
2. **No lower bound on past timestamps**: Except for monotonic ordering in move sequences
3. **Magic bypass**: 111970 allows complete circumvention of time rules
4. **Inconsistent validation**: Some operations validate on main chain, others don't
5. **Message replay potential**: No protection against timestamp reuse or manipulation
