# 🔍 Stress Test Results Analysis

## Overview

Based on the stress test results from `stress_test_results/`, I've identified several critical issues and patterns that explain the errors you've been experiencing.

## 📊 **Test Configuration Analysis**

### Test Setup
- **Date**: September 29, 2025 (11:45:23 and 11:45:41)
- **Target**: 200 concurrent players across multiple tournaments
- **Configuration**: 1 tournament with 1 shard each (reduced from planned 3 tournaments with 8 shards)
- **Duration**: 24 minutes planned test cycle

### Infrastructure
- **Service**: localhost:8088
- **Chain ID**: `3cf4f0714e42f665ad0fbd3641fa8a65a4e8cffe6888721f56dcb15b0a4ce2b0`
- **App ID**: `24545c214fa96afee8accc084594dfdc8b6211fa1543009c62d97fcb5fbcb7f8`

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified**

### 1. **Player Validation Panic (Primary Failure)**

**Error Pattern:**
```
RuntimeError: unreachable
at game2048_service::service_handlers::mutations::MutationHandler::validate_player_password
```

**Root Cause:**
The `validate_player_password` function is panicking with "unreachable" errors. This suggests:

1. **Player Not Found**: Players are being validated before their registration has been properly committed
2. **Race Condition**: Concurrent registrations are interfering with each other
3. **Chain Synchronization**: Player data isn't syncing between chains fast enough

**Impact**: ~30-50% of board creation attempts fail

### 2. **K6 Metrics Error**

**Error Pattern:**
```
'undefined' is an invalid value for metric 'errors', a number or a boolean value is expected
```

**Root Cause:**
The K6 stress test script has a bug in error metric reporting. The `errorRate.add()` call is receiving `undefined` values.

**Location**: `stress_test_k6.js` - custom error tracking

### 3. **Tournament Configuration Issues**

**Observations:**
- Only 1 tournament created instead of planned 3
- Only 1 shard per tournament instead of planned 8
- `totalBoards: 0` indicates no successful board registrations in tournament stats

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**

### Response Times (First 100 requests)
- **Minimum**: 39ms
- **Maximum**: 260ms  
- **Pattern**: Increasing response times (39ms → 260ms) indicating system stress
- **Status**: All HTTP requests returned 200 (no network failures)

### Player Registration Success
- **Total Attempts**: 10+ concurrent registrations
- **Success Rate**: ~50-70% (many players registered successfully)
- **Failures**: Board creation phase, not registration phase

### Board Creation Failures
- **VU 1, 11, 14**: Failed multiple board creations
- **VU 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13**: Successful board creations
- **Pattern**: Intermittent failures suggesting race conditions

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

### Primary Issue: Player Password Validation Panic

```rust
// src/service_handlers/mutations.rs (likely around line 32)
self.validate_player_password(&player, &password_hash).await;
```

**Problem**: This function panics when:
1. Player doesn't exist in cache/state
2. Password hash format is invalid  
3. Concurrent access to player data

### Secondary Issue: Timing/Synchronization

**Pattern Observed:**
- Some players succeed immediately
- Others fail consistently  
- Same players can succeed on retry

**Indicates**: 
- Player registration → chain commit → availability lag
- Need for retry logic or longer delays

### K6 Script Issues

**Bug in Error Handling:**
```javascript
// Current (broken):
errorRate.add(isError);  // isError can be undefined

// Should be:
errorRate.add(isError ? 1 : 0);
```

## 🛠 **Recommended Fixes**

### 1. **Immediate Code Fixes (High Priority)**

#### Fix Player Validation Panic:
```rust
// src/service_handlers/mutations.rs
async fn validate_player_password(&self, player: &str, password_hash: &str) -> Result<(), String> {
    match self.runtime.query_application(PlayerQuery { username: player.to_string() }).await {
        Ok(Some(player_data)) => {
            if player_data.password_hash == password_hash {
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Invalid password".to_string())
            }
        }
        Ok(None) => Err("Player not found".to_string()),
        Err(e) => Err(format!("Query failed: {}", e))
    }
}

// Update mutations to handle errors gracefully:
async fn new_board(...) -> Result<[u8; 0], String> {
    if let Err(e) = self.validate_player_password(&player, &password_hash).await {
        return Err(e);
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

#### Fix K6 Error Metrics:
```javascript
// stress_test_k6.js - fix error tracking
const isError = response.status !== 200 || 
               (response.body && JSON.parse(response.body).errors);

errorRate.add(isError ? 1 : 0);  // Ensure boolean conversion
```

### 2. **Stress Test Improvements (Medium Priority)**

#### Add Retry Logic:
```javascript
const retryOperation = async (operation, maxRetries = 3) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
        try {
            const result = await operation();
            if (result && result.status === 200) return result;
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(`Retry ${i + 1}/${maxRetries} failed: ${e}`);
        }
        sleep(1 + i); // Exponential backoff
    }
    return null;
};
```

#### Increase Delays:
```javascript
// After player registration
sleep(Math.random() * 3 + 2); // 2-5 seconds instead of 1-3

// Between board creations  
sleep(Math.random() * 2 + 1); // 1-3 seconds
```

### 3. **Configuration Adjustments (Low Priority)**

#### Start with Conservative Settings:
```bash
# Initial testing
./run_stress_test.sh CHAIN_ID APP_ID --tournaments 1 --shards 2

# Scale gradually
./run_stress_test.sh CHAIN_ID APP_ID --tournaments 2 --shards 4
./run_stress_test.sh CHAIN_ID APP_ID --tournaments 3 --shards 8
```

## 📋 **Test Results Summary**

| Metric | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Player Registration | ~70% success | ⚠️ Issues |
| Board Creation | ~50% success | ❌ Major issues |
| Response Times | 39-260ms | ⚠️ Degrading |
| HTTP Errors | 0% | ✅ Good |
| System Crashes | 0 | ✅ Good |
| Panic Errors | ~50% operations | ❌ Critical |

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### Immediate (Today)
1. Fix `validate_player_password` panic handling
2. Fix K6 error metrics bug
3. Test with single player to verify fixes

### Short Term (This Week)  
1. Add retry logic to K6 script
2. Implement graceful error handling in mutations
3. Test with 10-20 concurrent players

### Long Term (Next Week)
1. Add proper player state synchronization
2. Implement circuit breakers for high load
3. Scale test to full 200 concurrent players

## 💡 **Key Insights**

1. **Core Issue**: Player validation panics, not game logic issues
2. **Timing Matters**: Race conditions in player registration/validation
3. **HTTP Layer Works**: No network or service availability issues
4. **Partial Success**: Some operations succeed, indicating fixable issues
5. **K6 Script Bugs**: Metrics reporting needs fixes

The stress test revealed valuable insights about concurrency issues in the player validation system. These are fixable problems that don't require architectural changes.
