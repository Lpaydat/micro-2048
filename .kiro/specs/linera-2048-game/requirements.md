# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Linera 2048 Smart Contract is a backend-focused blockchain implementation of the 2048 puzzle game built on the Linera protocol. This smart contract handles core game logic, player management, tournament coordination, and cross-chain leaderboard synchronization. The design eliminates frontend dependencies, uses proper blockchain time handling via `runtime.system_time()`, and implements Domain-Driven Design principles to create a robust, secure, and scalable gaming backend that leverages Linera's unique capabilities.

6. WHEN tournament settings are updated THEN the system SHALL validate time constraints and participant limits
7. WHEN a tournament reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL prevent additional player registrations

### Requirement 4: Cross-Chain Leaderboard Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view real-time leaderboards across all game chains, so that I can track my ranking and compete with other players globally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player completes a game THEN their score SHALL be propagated to the appropriate leaderboard chain
2. WHEN leaderboard updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate rankings across all participants
3. WHEN multiple players have the same score THEN the system SHALL rank them by completion time

6. WHEN leaderboard data is synchronized THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using timestamp priority
7. WHEN displaying rankings THEN the system SHALL show player username, score, and completion status

### Requirement 5: Blockchain-Native State Management

**User Story:** As a smart contract, I want to manage game state using Linera's view system and blockchain time, so that state is consistent, verifiable, and eliminates frontend timing dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing operations THEN the contract SHALL use `runtime.system_time()` for all time-based logic
2. WHEN game state changes THEN the contract SHALL persist updates to MapView/RegisterView atomically
3. WHEN validating move sequences THEN the contract SHALL ensure timestamps are monotonically increasing using blockchain time
4. WHEN batch processing moves THEN the contract SHALL validate each move against current blockchain time
5. IF move validation fails THEN the contract SHALL return specific error types without state mutation
6. WHEN storing game data THEN the contract SHALL use Linera's view system for efficient state management
7. WHEN querying game state THEN the GraphQL service SHALL provide read-only access to persisted data

### Requirement 6: Administrative and Moderation Controls

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage players, tournaments, and system settings, so that I can maintain a fair and well-organized gaming platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin bans a player THEN the system SHALL prevent them from participating in new games
2. WHEN an admin creates a tournament THEN they SHALL have full control over settings and participants
3. WHEN moderators are assigned THEN they SHALL have limited administrative privileges for their assigned areas
4. WHEN administrative actions are taken THEN the system SHALL log them for audit purposes
5. IF unauthorized users attempt admin actions THEN the system SHALL reject them with permission errors
6. WHEN system settings are modified THEN the system SHALL validate changes and apply them consistently
7. WHEN reviewing player activity THEN admins SHALL have access to comprehensive player statistics

### Requirement 7: Blockchain Time-Based Validation (Fixed Architecture)

**User Story:** As a smart contract, I want to eliminate frontend timestamp dependencies by using `runtime.system_time()` exclusively, so that time validation is secure, consistent, and cannot be manipulated by clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation requires time validation THEN the contract SHALL use `runtime.system_time()` exclusively
2. WHEN tournament time limits are checked THEN the contract SHALL compare against blockchain time, not client-provided timestamps
3. WHEN move sequences are processed THEN the contract SHALL assign blockchain timestamps internally
