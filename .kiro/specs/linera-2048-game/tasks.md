# Implementation Plan

## Safe Development Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Each task must pass all steps before proceeding to the next task. This ensures blockchain smart contract safety and prevents deployment of broken code.

### Required Commands for Each Task:

1. **Unit Testing**: `cargo test --lib` (test domain logic)
2. **Integration Testing**: `cargo test tests::integration` (test with mock blockchain)
3. **WASM Build**: `cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` (ensure WASM compatibility)
4. **Deployment Test**: Deploy to local testnet and verify functionality

### Deployment Environment Setup:
```bash
export LINERA_WALLET="/tmp/.tmpkSarrS/wallet_0.json"
export LINERA_STORAGE="rocksdb:/tmp/.tmpkSarrS/client_0.db"
linera publish-and-create target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/game2048_contract.wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/game2048_service.wasm
```

### Failure Protocol:
- If any test fails: Fix the issue before proceeding
- If WASM build fails: Check for incompatible dependencies (especially time-related)
- If deployment fails: Verify contract instantiation and operation handling
- If functionality test fails: Debug using GraphQL queries and operation responses
